Tables are not styled
test-ccap/m-biology cnxml needs updating - current file is out of date and incorrect

=======
Table #/title/caption: all located on top of table --> against v17 Template Spec
Suggested all tables be 2 column (quicker/easier to develop)
1 column table bugs: (a)max-width: @column --> currently causes buggy table display (b)table headers recreated when table continues onto next page.

### About:
This diagram reflects the current prototype structure for LESS/CSS compiliation as used in Business Book Templates.  It's more of a reference tool and diagram of our current understanding and flow of the file structure and soon-to-be css framework that our books will be built off of.

### How to Edit:
It's being edited in draw.io , and can be freely edited there. It's pretty user friendly and doesn't require any istallation. 
Simply go to www.draw.io and open LESS_CSS Hierarchy Prototype.xml file in it.  You can save it locally and then push any changes as needed.

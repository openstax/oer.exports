<section><title>These are Biology "features" and are notes with special classes</title>

<para>To give you a sense of cell size, a typical human red blood cell is about eight millionths of a meter or eight micrometers (abbreviated as eight µm) in diameter; the head of a pin of is about two thousandths of a meter (two mm) in diameter. That means about 250 red blood cells could fit on the head of pin. 
	Most student microscopes are classified as light microscopes (Figure 04_01_01a). Visible light passes and is bent through the lens system to enable the user to see the specimen. Light microscopes are advantageous for viewing living organisms, but since individual cells are generally transparent, their components are not distinguishable unless they are colored with special stains. Staining, however, usually kills the cells.

Light microscopes commonly used in the undergraduate college laboratory magnify up to approximately 400 times. Two parameters that are important in microscopy are magnification and resolving power. Magnification is the process of enlarging an object in appearance. Resolving power is the ability of a microscope to distinguish two adjacent structures as separate; the higher the resolution, the better the clarity and detail of the image. When oil immersion lenses are used, magnification is usually increased to 1,000 times for the study of small microbes. In order to gain a better understanding of cellular structure and function, scientists typically use electron microscopes.</para>

		 Membrane and secretory proteins are synthesized in the RER. The RER also sometimes modifies proteins, In this illustration, a (color) integral 
		 membrane protein in the ER is modified by attachment of a (color) carbohydrate. Vesicles bud off from the ER and fuse with the cis face of the 
		 Golgi apparatus, As the protein passes through the Golgi’s cisternae, it is further modified by the addition of more carbohydrates. After its
		 synthesis is complete, its exitin vesicles bud off from the Golgi’s trans face and fuse with the cell membrane.

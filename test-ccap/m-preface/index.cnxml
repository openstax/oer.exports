      <title>About Biology</title>
      <para id="import-auto-id1164231453381"><emphasis effect="italics">Biology</emphasis> is designed for multi-semester biology courses for science majors. It is grounded on an evolutionary basis and includes exciting features that highlight careers in the biological sciences and everyday applications of the concepts at hand. To meet the needs of today’s instructors and students, some content has been strategically condensed while maintaining the overall scope and coverage of traditional texts for this course. Instructors can customize the book, adapting it to the approach that works best in their classroom. <emphasis effect="italics">Biology</emphasis> also includes an innovative art program that incorporates critical thinking and clicker questions to help students understand—and apply—key concepts. </para>

      <title>Coverage and Scope</title>
      <para id="import-auto-id1164221149313">Biology meets the scope and sequence of a typical two semester biology course for biology majors, pre-med majors, and science majors. In developing <emphasis effect="italics">Biology</emphasis>, we listened to hundreds of General Biology instructors who readily provided feedback about their courses, students, challenges, and hopes for innovation. The expense of textbooks and related items did prove to be a barrier to learning.  But more importantly, these teachers suggested improvements for the textbook, which would ultimately lead to more meaningful and memorable learning experiences for students.  </para>
      <para id="import-auto-id1164201876325">The result is a book that addresses a core organizational reality of the course and its materials – the sheer breadth of the topical coverage.  We provide a thorough treatment of biology’s foundational concepts while condensing selected topics in response to the market’s request for a textbook with a scope that is manageable for instructors and students alike. We also strive to make biology, as a discipline, interesting and accessible to students. In addition to a comprehensive coverage of core concepts and foundational research, we have incorporated features that draw learners into the discipline in meaningful ways.  </para>
      <para id="import-auto-id1164185871638">The pedagogical choices, chapter arrangements, and learning objective fulfillment were developed and vetted with the feedback of another one hundred reviewers, who thoroughly read the material and offered detailed critical commentary. </para>

      <para id="import-auto-id1164220079123">WileyPLUS provides an engaging online environment for effective teaching and learning. WileyPLUS builds students’ confidence because it takes the guesswork out of studying by providing a clear roadmap; what to do, how to do it, and if they did it right. With WileyPLUS, students take more initiative. Therefore, the course has a greater impact on their learning experience. Adaptive tools provide students with a personal, adaptive learning experience so they can build their proficiency on topics and use their study time most effectively. Please let us know if you would like to participate in a Fall 2013 Pilot.</para>

      <para id="import-auto-id1164199701605">SimBio’s interactive modules (virtual labs and interactive tutorials and chapters) provide engaging, discovery-based learning tools that complement many of the chapters of Concepts of Biology. SimBio is best known for their EcoBeaker® and EvoBeaker® suites of simulated ecology and evolution laboratories that guide students through the “discovery” of important concepts via a mix of structured and open-ended experimentation on simulated systems. In response to popular demand, SimBio has begun applying the same powerful approaches to topics in cell biology, genetics, and neurobiology. All of SimBio’s modules include instant-feedback questions that enhance student comprehension and auto-graded questions that facilitate implementation. <figure id="import-auto-id1164206780626"><media id="import-auto-id1164190258354" alt=""><image mime-type="image/png" src="Picture 1.png" height="319" width="433"/></media></figure></para></item>

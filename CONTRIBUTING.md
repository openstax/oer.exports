##using one branch as a milestone overview
We create one big pull request for each release. The pull request is centralizing all the issues related to the milestone.

##referencing issues when committing
Use "issue #1111" within commit messages. You may add a descriptive comment when needed, for example "issue #1111 - changing font-size"

##commenting on the issue when addressed in the PR
When the fix for an issue has been pushed to github and is ready for review, go to the issue and reference the PR in the comments

##reassign to Kerwin or the testing person when the fix is on github
Reassign an issue to Kerwin only when it is ready for testing and the files are on github.
